# Galaxy_Shooter
 A 2.5D arcade style shooter, like asteroids developed using Unity3D for both PC and Android in 2021. This is my first ever game project built with Unity Engine using C#. I have made this game for Android and PC Build. This is a retro style game with few special power features like Speed, Triple Fire and Shield.
